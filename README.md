# Godot Template
## Features
- Static typing
- Serializable settings with localization setting
- Simple scene switcher
## Disadvantages
- no backward compability when you change input mapping, so you need to erase settings file in local files, for example in %APPDATA% folder if you are in Windows
- No more than 1 hardware input on 1 action
- This template in fact in an Alpha stage with no way to get to Release in near times
